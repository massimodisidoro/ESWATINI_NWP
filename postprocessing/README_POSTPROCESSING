#MAPS CUSTOMIZATIONS:

#ADDING AND REMOVING A VARIABLE IN MAPS PLOTS:
edit var.yaml to add or remove a variable in the output maps
 ADDING a VARIABLE: 
     from the file var.yaml_all_vars you can see all the available variables for plotting, 
     just copy tha block of keys corresponding to the desired one and paste it at the end (or between two vars definitions) in var.yaml
 REMOVING a VARIABLE: 
     just remove the correspondent block of keys from var.yaml

EXAMPLE: 
    if you want to produce temperature at 300hPa plot in output, just copy the corresponding
    block in var.yaml_all_vars; that is:
'T300':

    'wrf_name'       : 'tc'
    'type'           : 'lev'
    'pressure_level' : 300
    'varname'        : 't300'
    'contour'        : True
    'overlap_fields' : False
    'windvectors'    : False
    'wrf_name2'      : 'none'
    'varname_additional'    : 'none'
    'title'          : 'Temperature at 300 hPa (Â°C)'
    'colormap'       : 'turbo'

     and paste it into var.yaml. The field will be produced starting from the following forecast.


#MODIFY CONTOUR LEVELS IN MAP PLOTS
To modify contour levels in maps, just edit the def_vars.py file in this folder:
   It defines some features of the maps plotted:
    Note that varname is the correspondend "varname" key in
    the configuration file vars.yaml, in which the actual
    variables to be plotted are defined
    The colour/contour levels (variable "levels") values are defined
    in terms of range (np.range: min, max, delta) or single values.
    The variable "extend_colorbar" indicates if colorbar must indicate
    out of range values in max and min (extend_colorbar = 'both')
    or only  for maximum extend_colorbar = 'max') or minimum
    (extend_colorbar = 'min') values.
    NOTE: ONLY for Precipitation the NUMBER of levels is FIXED, you
    can change the values but not the number of levels. For the other
    fields you can change values and number of levels.


#METEOGRAMS AND PROFILES CUSTOMIZATION

You can add up to 30 sites for which produce meteorgams and profile plots.
This can be done adding one line for each new location in the file tslist.
As it is esplained in the header,
Each record must provide: 
  name: max 24 character length, no blank spaces within the name 
  pfs: a prefix, to be used in output files (max 5 characters) 
  LAT: latitude (total 7 characters) 
  LON: longitude (total 8 characters) 
 
NOTE: !!! be carefull not to get outside the  
 start and the beginning of each variable 
 Keep the same alignment as the default records 
 Mababane and Airport !!!!

When you modify tslist file, adding or removing locations, the following
forecast will contain the updated results
